These scripts are provided to reproduce the Enhanced Cascade Sample.  The flow
is as follows:

1a. Data is gathered from subruns located in /data/ana and saved in full runs in
/data/user/ssclafani

1b. MC (Nugen, Corsika, and MuonGun) are processed and hdf5 files are saved

2. Those files are processed and DNNs and Cascade Generator are added, per run
i3 and hdf5 files are saved

3. The hdf5 files are combined and then relevant keys are selected and saved to
a pandas array

4. The MC is trained in two steps.  Step 01 seperates bg muons from neutrinos,
Step 02 selects for cascades, removing obvious tracks

5. Data is processed through BDT, GRL is added
